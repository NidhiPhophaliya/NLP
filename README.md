# 🧠 Mini Search Engine — Machine Learning in Healthcare

A lightweight **Python search engine** built from scratch that ranks short topic-based articles about **Machine Learning in Healthcare** using **TF–IDF relevance** and **ArticleRank** (a PageRank-style centrality score computed on a similarity graph).

This project demonstrates how a simple combination of **vector space modeling** and **graph algorithms** can produce a surprisingly intelligent search system — all in under 200 lines of code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **TF–IDF based search relevance** using cosine similarity  
- **ArticleRank**: PageRank applied on document similarity graph  
- **Hybrid scoring** combining local relevance and global importance  
- **Interactive CLI** for running queries in real time  
- Simple, interpretable, and fully self-contained — no external API or large models needed

## 🧩 Technologies Used

| Component | Purpose | Library |
|------------|----------|----------|
| TF–IDF Vectorizer | Converts text to numeric feature vectors | `scikit-learn` |
| Cosine Similarity | Measures query–document and document–document similarity | `scikit-learn` |
| Graph Representation | Builds similarity graph | `networkx` |
| PageRank (ArticleRank) | Computes document importance | `networkx` |
| Arrays & Math | Normalization and scoring | `numpy` |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Corpus Setup**  
   A small in-memory dataset (`ARTICLES`) contains 10 articles on *Machine Learning in Healthcare*.

2. **TF–IDF Vectorization**  
   Each document is transformed into a high-dimensional vector using the **TF–IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** method.

3. **Document Similarity Graph**  
   Documents are compared pairwise using cosine similarity.  
   If similarity ≥ threshold (0.12), an undirected weighted edge is created between the documents.

4. **ArticleRank Calculation**  
   The document similarity graph is fed into the **PageRank** algorithm (via NetworkX).  
   Documents central to the network (i.e., similar to many important documents) get higher ArticleRank.

5. **Hybrid Ranking**  
   When a user enters a query:
   - Compute TF–IDF cosine similarity between query and all documents.  
   - Normalize relevance and ArticleRank to [0,1].  
   - Combine with weight `alpha`:
     ```
     final_score = alpha * relevance + (1 - alpha) * article_rank
     ```
   - Sort and return top results.

6. **Interactive Search**  
   Users type queries in the console and instantly get ranked results with scores and snippets.

---

## 🧮 Equation Summary

\[
\text{FinalScore}_i = \alpha \times \text{Relevance}_i + (1 - \alpha) \times \text{ArticleRank}_i
\]

- **Relevance** — TF–IDF cosine similarity of query and document  
- **ArticleRank** — PageRank centrality score from document similarity graph  
- **α (alpha)** — Weight factor between [0,1]; default = 0.7

# 💬 Sentiment Analysis using VADER

A Python-based **rule-driven Sentiment Analysis System** built with the **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** model from NLTK.  
It classifies text into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments, providing detailed intensity scores for each emotion.

This enhanced version includes **colored terminal output**, **interactive input options**, and **summary statistics** to give a complete, real-time understanding of text sentiment — whether it’s tweets, reviews, or healthcare feedback.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Sentiment analysis is a form of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that helps computers interpret human emotions from text.  
In this project, we use a **rule-based approach** that assigns predefined sentiment scores to words and combines them to infer the overall sentiment.

VADER is ideal for analyzing:
- Short, informal text (tweets, reviews, feedback)
- Sentences containing slang, emojis, or emphasis (like “great!!!” or “BAD 😡”)
- Real-time streaming data (social media, chatbot logs)

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Rule-based sentiment analysis (no training required)  
✅ Supports custom input or text file analysis  
✅ Color-coded terminal output for clarity  
✅ Displays positive, neutral, negative, and compound scores  
✅ Summary of overall sentiment distribution  
✅ Fully offline, lightweight, and fast  

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

| Component | Description | Library |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **NLTK** | Natural Language Toolkit, provides VADER sentiment analyzer | `nltk` |
| **VADER Lexicon** | Predefined dictionary of sentiment-weighted words | Built into NLTK |
| **Colorama** | Adds terminal colors for better visualization | `colorama` |
| **Python 3.x** | Core programming environment | - |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1 — Preprocessing
Each sentence is cleaned internally by VADER (tokenization, punctuation handling, emphasis detection).

### Step 2 — Scoring
VADER calculates:
- **pos** — proportion of positive words  
- **neu** — proportion of neutral words  
- **neg** — proportion of negative words  
- **compound** — overall normalized polarity score in range **[-1, 1]**

### Step 3 — Classification
| Range of Compound Score | Label |
|--------------------------|--------|
| ≥ 0.05 | Positive 😊 |
| ≤ -0.05 | Negative 😠 |
| otherwise | Neutral 😐 |

### Step 4 — Display
The result is printed with:
- Detailed sentiment breakdown  
- Final label (Positive / Negative / Neutral)  
- Color-coded text for easy interpretation  

### Step 5 — Summary Statistics
At the end, total counts and percentages of each sentiment category are displayed.

---

## 🧮 Algorithm Summary

\[
\text{Sentiment Label} =
\begin{cases}
\text{Positive,} & \text{if compound ≥ 0.05} \\
\text{Negative,} & \text{if compound ≤ -0.05} \\
\text{Neutral,} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Where:
- `compound` = weighted normalized sum of all sentiment lexicon ratings.
